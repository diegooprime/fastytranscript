# FastyTranscript

Raycast extension that fetches YouTube transcripts.

I watch a lot of YouTube. Sometimes I want the transcript to feed into an LLM or skim content faster. This does that in 2 seconds.

## Demo

## Usage

1. Copy YouTube URL
2. Run **FastyTranscript** in Raycast
3. Transcript auto-copied to clipboard

## How It Works

Tries three strategies in order:
1. **ANDROID InnerTube API** — fastest and most reliable
2. **YouTube page scraping** — extracts captions from `ytInitialPlayerResponse`
3. **yt-dlp fallback** — requires [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) installed locally

## Output

```markdown
# Video Title

**URL:** https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
