# FastyTranscript

Raycast extension to fetch YouTube transcripts. Fast.

## How it works

1. Copy a YouTube URL
2. Run the command
3. Transcript is copied to clipboard (Markdown formatted)

## Why I built this

I watch a lot of YouTube. Sometimes I want the transcript to feed into an LLM or skim the content. This does that in 2 seconds.

## Credit

Forked from the [original extension](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/fetch-youtube-transcript) and made it way faster.
